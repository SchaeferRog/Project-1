# Air Quality Analysis for Nebraska (2024–2025)

The goal of this project is to provide the UNMC Water, Climate and Health Group with an analysis of air quality conditions across Nebraska using AirPurple sensor data collected from February 2024 through March 2025.

The project focuses on evaluating concentrations of:
- VOCs
- PM2.5
- PM10

The objectives are to:
- Determine whether recorded values align with EPA air quality standards.
- Assess whether air quality in Nebraska meets National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS).
- Identify locations where pollutant levels may pose public health concerns.
